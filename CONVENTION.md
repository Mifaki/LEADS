# Repository Convention

This repository follows a set of conventions to maintain a consistent and organized structure. Please adhere to these conventions when creating and organizing files.

## File Naming Convention

- All file names must use `kebab-case` format.
- Use lowercase letters for file names.
- Separate words with hyphens.

## Directory Structure

The repository is structured as follows:

```
- Pages/
  - index.html
  - about.html
  - ...
- Styles/
  - main.css
  - styles.css
  - ...
- JS/
  - script.js
  - app.js
  - ...
- Content/
  - images/
    - image1.jpg
    - image2.png
    - ...
  - icons/
    - icon1.svg
    - icon2.svg
    - ...
  - ...
```

### Pages Directory

All HTML files should be placed in the `Pages` directory. This directory serves as the container for all web page files.

### Styles Directory

All CSS stylesheets should be placed in the `Styles` directory. This directory contains the stylesheets used to define the visual appearance of the web pages.

### JS Directory

All JavaScript files should be placed in the `JS` directory. This directory contains the JavaScript code used to add interactivity and functionality to the web pages.

### Content Directory

All content-related files, such as images, icons, and other media files, should be placed in the `Content` directory. This directory is further organized into subdirectories based on the type of content.

- The `images` directory stores image files (e.g., `.jpg`, `.png`).
- The `icons` directory stores SVG icon files.
- Additional subdirectories can be created based on the specific needs of the project.

## Example Usage

Here's an example of how you can use these conventions in your repository:

```
- Pages/
  - index.html
  - about.html
  - contact.html
- Styles/
  - main.css
  - responsive.css
